And importantly good quantity!\nI wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option 🙈\nExtensive...\nAmbience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!\nFood! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian 🙈)\nThe good part! Quantity 😍\nI was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.\nThe daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(\nThe breads and raita were decent!\nThe Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step 🙈\nConclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.\nWould like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!",

         "My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.\nThey're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.\nThe menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits\n\nPanko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ❤️ - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.\nVeg Lasagna ❤️ - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.\nCrispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.\nMakhmali Paneer Tikka -\nCottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler\nItalian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.\nCheese and Cheese Pizza ❤️ - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.\n\nI cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.\n\nThe staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!",

We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer.",
